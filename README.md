# New York Coffee Run

The New York Coffee Run project is a React application designed for a running event where participants can submit their best running photos for a chance to win a coffee gift card in a random drawing. The application features sections for different activities (Run, Walk, Jog), an upload section for submitting photos, and a results section displaying the drawing outcome. The front end of the project is built using React, offering a responsive and interactive user interface, while the backend is developed with .NET, providing robust and scalable server-side functionality to handle photo uploads and manage the event data.
